# AudioInput

Taken from the Theremino_AudioInput application, "From audio to ThereminoSlots", by Theremino System.  
Migration to .Net 8 from Theremino_AudioInput v. 12.8, using the .NetFramework 3.5, taken from Theremino site. 

Note: the Theremino team doesn't want to pass to .Net Core >, because they think that it is too bigger and slower than Framework 3.5, this porting is made by me, for my own purpose.
